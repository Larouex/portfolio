### Normandy Park Police Foundation

As a Board Member of the [Normandy Park Police Foundation](https://www.normandyparkpolicefoundation.org), I designed and developed a cutting-edge website to enhance community engagement and public safety initiatives.

Leveraging my expertise in web development, I created a dynamic and user-friendly platform using React, showcasing the following key features:

- Interactive BlockWatch maps to improve neighborhood safety coordination
- Responsive design for seamless access across all devices
- Integration with community alliance programs and public safety resources
- Custom content management system for easy updates by foundation staff

This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced web technologies to support local law enforcement and strengthen community ties. The website serves as a central hub for residents to access important information, participate in safety programs, and stay connected with their local police department.

### Larouex Nonprofit Consulting: Revolutionizing Nonprofit Operations with AI

#### The Frontier Firm for Nonprofits

Larouex Nonprofit Consulting is dedicated to empowering nonprofit organizations to thrive in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Our mission-driven approach leverages cutting-edge AI solutions to amplify impact, streamline operations, and foster deeper community engagement. The "2025 Work Trend Index Annual Report" by Microsoft highlights a pivotal shift: the emergence of the "Frontier Firm"—an organization powered by "intelligence on tap" and "human-agent teams". This concept is not just for corporations; it's a blueprint for nonprofits to scale rapidly, operate with agility, and generate value faster, even with limited resources.

#### Our Approach: Building Human-Led, AI-Operated Systems

We believe that the future of nonprofit work is **human-led and AI-operated**. This means blending machine intelligence with invaluable human judgment to create systems that support and empower your team. Our strategy unfolds in three phases, tailored to the unique needs of nonprofits:

- **Phase 1: Human with Assistant** Every employee has an AI assistant that helps them work better and faster.
- **Phase 2: Human-Agent Teams** Agents join teams as "digital colleagues," taking on specific tasks at human direction. These agents equip employees with new skills that help scale their impact—freeing them to do new and more valuable work.
- **Phase 3: Human-Led, Agent-Operated** Humans set direction for agents that run entire business processes and workflows, checking in as needed.

#### Addressing the Nonprofit Capacity Gap with "Intelligence on Tap"

Nonprofits often face a significant "capacity gap"—the deficit between business demands and the maximum capacity of humans alone to meet them. The report indicates that 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, yet 80% of the global workforce—both employees and leaders—say they're lacking enough time or energy to do their work. "Intelligence on tap" directly addresses this by providing abundant, affordable, and on-demand digital labor.

We focus on using AI to remove repetitive and time-consuming tasks, allowing your dedicated staff to concentrate on creativity, judgment, and connection-building—the uniquely human aspects that drive your mission forward.

#### Key Benefits for Nonprofits

- **Enhanced Donor & Community Engagement**: Prioritize features and content that enhance donor management, volunteer coordination, and community engagement. Recommend automation for personalized donor journeys, timely acknowledgments, and effective communication strategies.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate workflows and processes, from answering support tickets to drafting reports, freeing up valuable staff time[cite: 186].
- **Data Integration & Clarity**: Suggest solutions that unify data across platforms (CRMs, email, reporting) and promote actionable insights. Emphasize data consistency, privacy, and security in all technical guidance.
- **Strategic Guidance & Capacity Building**: Our solutions are designed to build long-term capacity within your organization, providing guidance, training, and documentation for sustainable growth. We encourage knowledge sharing and team empowerment in all project deliverables.
- **Impact Measurement**: Include methods for tracking and reporting the tangible impact of implemented solutions (e.g., time saved, donor retention improvements, increased fundraising). Align success metrics with nonprofit objectives, not just technical deliverables.

#### Our Commitment to Your Mission

At Larouex Nonprofit Consulting, we prioritize solutions that are affordable, scalable, and easy for nonprofits to adopt. We champion technologies like n8n for their suitability for organizations with limited resources, ensuring that every recommendation is tailored to your unique needs and constraints. Our collaborative and transparent approach ensures that all solutions align with your organizational culture and goals, empowering your team every step of the way.

#### Ready to Transform Your Nonprofit?

The time for pilots alone has passed. Real change requires broad adoption and activation at every level of the organization[cite: 194]. The "Frontier Firm" is taking shape, and within the next 2-5 years, every organization is expected to be on this journey. We are here to help your nonprofit adapt and lead in this new era of work.

### Normandy Park Police Foundation

As a Board Member of the [Normandy Park Police Foundation](https://www.normandyparkpolicefoundation.org), I designed and developed a cutting-edge website to enhance community engagement and public safety initiatives.

Leveraging my expertise in web development, I created a dynamic and user-friendly platform using React, showcasing the following key features:

- Interactive BlockWatch maps to improve neighborhood safety coordination
- Responsive design for seamless access across all devices
- Integration with community alliance programs and public safety resources
- Custom content management system for easy updates by foundation staff

This project demonstrates my ability to apply advanced web technologies to support local law enforcement and strengthen community ties. The website serves as a central hub for residents to access important information, participate in safety programs, and stay connected with their local police department.
